4. Constraints (VERY IMPORTANT)
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
UNIQUE
NOT NULL
CHECK
DEFAULT


Example:

CREATE TABLE emp (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
);

🔹 5. Aggregate Functions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
SELECT SUM(age) FROM table_name;
SELECT AVG(age) FROM table_name;
SELECT MIN(age) FROM table_name;
SELECT MAX(age) FROM table_name;

🔹 6. GROUP BY & HAVING (EXAM FAVORITE ⭐)
SELECT age, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY age;

SELECT age, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY age
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

🔹 7. Joins (VERY VERY IMPORTANT ⭐⭐⭐)
SELECT *
FROM emp
INNER JOIN dept
ON emp.dept_id = dept.id;


Types:

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN

RIGHT JOIN

FULL JOIN

🔹 8. Subquery
SELECT name
FROM emp
WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM emp);

🔹 9. Keys & Index
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table_name(name);
DROP INDEX idx_name;

🔹 10. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK;
SAVEPOINT sp1;

🔹 11. View
CREATE VIEW emp_view AS
SELECT name, age FROM emp;

DROP VIEW emp_view;

🔹 12. Interview / MCQ MUST-KNOW

DELETE vs TRUNCATE

WHERE vs HAVING

PRIMARY KEY vs UNIQUE

JOIN vs SUBQUERY

INDEX advantages

ACID properties
